                <img src="makka.jpg"/>
                <p>Mecca is a holy place of Muslims in Saudi Arabia where it is 
                    believed that the prophet Muhammad lived and taught more 
                    than 1,300 years ago. Mecca is the holiest city in Islam. 
                    Mecca had become an important place in the history by the 
                    time when Prophet Mohammed (peace is upon him) was born in 
                    about 570 AD. Mecca, the holy place has fallen with yearly 
                    ebb and flow of pilgrims as a result of growing Muslim 
                    community in the World and eventually the spread of Islam. 
                    The economic status of the city greatly depends on the large number of pilgrims visiting 
                    every year and their accommodation, feeding and 
                    transportation.

                <p>Medina is one of Islam's two holiest cities, 
                    making it a key destination for millions of pilgrims 
                    traveling to Saudi Arabia for Hajj or Umrah. The city is 
                    centered around Al Masjid an Nabawi, also known as the 
                    Prophet's Mosque, which was constructed 
                    by the Prophet himself and is also where he is 
                    buried.
